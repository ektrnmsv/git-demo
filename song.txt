When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be".

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, "Let it be".

And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
